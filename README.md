## :notebook: Key features

- **Gallery**: auto-generated thumbnails are presented on **CSS Grid** with **infinite scroll**.
- Beautiful **"postcard" view** for photos with **fullscreen toggle**.
- Both views are **responsive** with **minimal whitespace** and **polished UX**.
- Many **performance optimizations** for image delivery (both by Gatsby & way beyond what Gatsby can do).

## :zap: Get started

1. Fork and `npm install`.
2. Drop your photos in `content/images`.
3. Run in dev mode with `gatsby develop`.  
...and you're all set! (Ok you probably want to edit some text, colors, favicon, etc. - but almost done!)
